Le Place Milton,220 Milton,Restaurants,Brunch,Plateau Mont Royal,514.285.0011,http://montrealbreakfastreview.com/place-milton,$,M,"Place Milton is a all-day breakfast place that closes early but makes you want to stumble out of your apartment the morning after whatever happened last night that involved booze. Stick with the classic breakfast - The Place Milton - that gets you eggs, ham, sausage, bacon (that's three kinds of pig in one meal...), plus two pancakes, and potatoes. Coffee is endless and though the food isn't amazing, it'll sure fill you up and soak up some of what you shouldn't have drank the night before. McGill-ians love it. Expect mini-lines on weekends.","Breakfast of Champions, I Shouldn't Have Had That Sixth Drink, Hair of the Dog","45.515488, -73.571184"
